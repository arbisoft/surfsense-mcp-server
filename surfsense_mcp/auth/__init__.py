"""Per-request auth headers for SurfSense backend calls.

Two transports, two strategies:

- **stdio** (single-user, on a developer's laptop) → ``Authorization: Bearer
  <surfsense-jwt>`` from ``SURFSENSE_JWT`` or the password fallback.
- **http** (multi-user, behind FastMCP's ``AWSCognitoProvider``) →
  ``X-Auth-Request-User`` derived from the validated Cognito token's
  ``username`` claim. The Cognito Bearer is *not* forwarded.

The dispatcher in :func:`build_auth_headers` picks based on whether a FastMCP
HTTP request scope is active. See :mod:`surfsense_mcp.auth.stdio` and
:mod:`surfsense_mcp.auth.http` for the per-mode internals.
